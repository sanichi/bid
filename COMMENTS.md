I'll analyze the project structure and codebase to provide feedback. Let me examine key files and patterns.

Based on my analysis of the codebase, here are my observations and comments:

## Strengths

**Architecture & Code Quality:**
- Clean Rails architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Good use of concerns (`Constrainable`, `Linkable`, `Pageable`, `Remarkable`)
- Well-structured domain models (`Hand`, `Bids`) with proper validation
- Comprehensive test coverage using RSpec
- Modern Rails 8 with good dependency choices

**Domain Implementation:**
- Excellent bridge-specific logic in `Hand` and `Bids` classes
- Proper spaced repetition algorithm implementation in `Review` model
- Smart session-based review tracking in controller

## Areas for Improvement

**Code Issues:**
- **Bug in Review model** (`review.rb:14`): Assignment should use `self.repetitions = 0` instead of `repetitions = 0`
- Missing `inverse_of` associations (recommended for Rails performance)
- Some hardcoded magic numbers (`1.3`, `0.08`, `0.02` in Review calculations)

**Security & Best Practices:**
- No strong parameters validation for nested attributes
- Session data management could be more robust (no validation of session integrity)
- Missing CSRF protection verification in review updates

**Performance Concerns:**
- `problems_controller.rb:64-66`: N+1 queries with `pluck(:id).join(",")`
- Complex session-based review logic could be moved to a service object
- No database indexes visible for common queries (shape, points, due dates)

**Maintainability:**
- Complex controller logic in `ProblemsController` (130+ lines) - could benefit from service objects
- The `okay` method name is unclear (line 122)
- String interpolation for titles instead of I18n (lines 114, 116)

**Missing Features:**
- No API versioning or JSON responses
- Limited error handling for edge cases
- No background job processing for potentially long operations

The codebase shows solid Rails fundamentals and domain expertise in bridge, but would benefit from refactoring complex controller logic and addressing the identified bug.
